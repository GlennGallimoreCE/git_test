If you're like me and are a total noob in Linux/Git this is my cheatsheet
going forward with my training.


cd = goes in a directory by one
cd/something/something  =  Can be specific
cd .. = goes up a directory
cd ~  = goes back to main

mkdir = makes a folder in a specific directory (ex. mkdir New_folder)
touch = creates any file in a specific directory (ex. touch file.txt)


GIT commands
------------------------------------
git -- version = tells you latest version of Git
git config = runs a configuration
git clone = creates a clone of your Github URL, be sure to copy it first!
git remote -v = Displays the URL of the respositry

git status = tracks files.  Red text means it's not staged, Green means staged
git add <filename> = adds specified file to the staging area (green)
git commit -m "comment" = Commits your changes in the staging area
*** always check with git status after a commit to make sure your working tree is clean.

git log = details on activity
